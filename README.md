## CS305 May 6th React Workshop

Notes:

- React creates a virtual DOM
- When data changes, only the affected component refreshes
- App.test.js uses Jest and runs when npm start runs
- Capitalizing file and class names is standard naming convention
- ES6 destructuring and map used in this project
- the old way of creating state required wrapping it in a constructor/super (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30571875/whats-the-difference-between-super-and-superprops-in-react-when-using-e?rq=1)
